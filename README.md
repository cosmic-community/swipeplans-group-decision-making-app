## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> "I want to create a mobile website that is similar function to Tinder where you swipe on things, right for yes and left for no, but the things are tiles filled with whatever you want (movies to watch, date night, various activities, book club ideas) you name it. I want you to be able to create the list of things that will appear in the swiping options and then I want you to be able to create a unique code that unlocks that set of tiles. You then send the code out to whoever you want (friends, family, partners) and then they can use the code to unlock the set of tiles to swipe on. From there they can swipe right on the ones that are a yes and left on a no, and then just like tinder, if everyone in the group swipes right on something then it's a match and everyone can know about the match, and if it's a no then no one is notified that there isn't a match. Essentially this mobile site is a way for people to decide on things as a group without having to discuss it or have their feelings hurt on if there isn't a match. Can we build this?"

### Code Generation Prompt

> Create the mobile app for this swiping idea and connect it with the Cosmic CMS.

```

### Get Tiles for Swiping
```javascript
// Get all tiles for a specific tile set
const tiles = await cosmic.objects.find({
  type: 'tiles',
  'metadata.tile_set': tileSetId
}).props(['id', 'title', 'metadata']).depth(1)
```

### Record Swipe Results
```javascript
// Save a user's swipe decision
await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
  type: 'swipe-results',
  title: `${sessionId}-${tileId}-swipe`,
  metadata: {
    session: sessionId,
    tile: tileId,
    decision: 'Yes', // or 'No'
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})
```

### Create New Session
```javascript
// Start a new swiping session
const session = await cosmic.objects.insertOne({

  title: `Session-${participantId}`,
  metadata: {
    tile_set: tileSetId,
    participant_id: participantId,
    participant_name: displayName,
    started_date: new Date().toISOString(),
    is_complete: false
  }
})
```
